            reasonable efforts to meet the estimated delivery schedule. However, the Company shall not be liable for failure to deliver, or
            delays in delivery caused by strikes, lockout, fires, inability to obtain material or shipping space, breakdowns, delays of carriers,
            suppliers of subcontractors, governmental acts, acts of God, defective specifications, defective Customer testing, or any causes
            beyond the control and without fault or negligence of the Company. Any delay in delivery resulting from any of these causes does
            not entitle the Customer to withdraw from the contract nor does it entitle the Customer to compensation or loss arising from such
            delay. Deliveries of goods completed or in process may not be extended beyond original specified delivery date.
