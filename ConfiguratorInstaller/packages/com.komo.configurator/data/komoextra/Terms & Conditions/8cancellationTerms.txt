Once an order is accepted by the Company, it cannot be canceled, except with the Companys written consent.
In addition, Company and Customer agree that it may be difficult, if not impossible, to accurately determine the amount of
damage arising from cancellation by Customer. Therefore, Customer agrees if an order is canceled with written consent of the
Company, more than fifteen (15) days after the date of the order, the Customer shall remain liable for a liquidated damages
payment of not less than the original nonrefundable down payment and up to 100% of the purchase order price, depending upon
the percentage of completion of the machine at the time of cancellation.
