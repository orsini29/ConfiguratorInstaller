*Note:

*If a warranty claim is requested, the customer will need to provide a purchase order number to Komo Machine before the service
*call can be scheduled. An evaluation during or after the service call will determine whether the service call is a valid warranty
*claim. If it is determined to be a valid warranty claim, the purchase order will be considered void, and Komo Machine will cover all
*expenses. If the failure is determined to be from a crash or neglect, the call will be deemed non-warranty and all charges and
*fees will be invoiced against the purchase order number.
*Warranty is transferable, but requires a pre-production inspection and re-installation by Komo Machine.
*The foregoing warranties are exclusive and are in lieu of all other warranties. Komo makes no other warranty of any kind
*whatever, express or implied; and all implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are hereby
